SOCIAL NETWORK PROJECT

This is Project 1 in my CS-315 Data Structures class

This is a bare bones social network (no special CSS formatting)
the project traverses/tokenizes through a JSON file and creates 'users' without using any special libraries to help.

Each user has some data attached to it like (name, location, profile picture, followers, following, mutual followers)
